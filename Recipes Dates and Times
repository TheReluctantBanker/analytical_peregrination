##### Recipes for dates and times in R


#### Load necessary libraries

```{r}

library(lubridate)

```



#### Converting numbers to dates

Suppose if data that you have has got date having an integer value ( days since unix epoch of 1st Jan 1970), then you need to convert the integer to date

```{r}

date_in_integer_form=12000
date_in_date_form =as.Date(date_in_integer_form,origin='1970-01-01')
date_in_date_form
class(date_in_date_form) #is a date object

```

#### When you want to extract /format dates in specified ways

Recipe for extracting month from a given date

```{r}

#we will use the date_in_date_form created earlier

#now to extract the month from this 
month(date_in_date_form)

#now to extract the year from this
year(date_in_date_form)


```


Recipes for extracting only specific portions from date
Suppose you have date in YYYY-MM-DD format, but you want to extract only YYYY-MM as DD is not relevant for the analysis that you are doing.

The format function helps you to transform the date and get only the portions required

```{r}

date_example ='1991-12-31' # in YYYY-MM-DD form
date_YYYY_MM_only =format(as.Date(date_example,"%Y-%m-%d"),"%Y-%m") # first step we are first ensuring that the variable is in date in its default form. we then use format to transform its form.
date_YYYY_MM_only


```

#### When you want to calculate difference between dates/times

Recipe for using the diffitme function which helps you get the difference between two dates in different units

Differences can be obtained in days, weeks, hours, mins, seconds

```{r}

date1='2018-03-02'
date2='1981-03-02'

date1_formatted=as.Date(date1,"%Y-%m-%d")
date2_formatted=as.Date(date2,"%Y-%m-%d")

time_difference_days =difftime(time1=date1_formatted,time2=date2_formatted,units='days')
time_difference_days

```
