#### Recipes for probability and distribution related concepts

sample function can be used to simulate the results of games of chance or events where the outcome is one of several possible outcomes

Examples for use of sample function
Default behaviour is sampling without replacement

```{r}

#pick 5 numbers in random from the sequence 1:40
sample(x=1:40,size=5)

#rewrite the first argument as just a number instead of seqeuence
sample(x=40,size=5)

#to do sampling with replacement, for example simulating multiple coin tosses
#Here we simulate 3 coin tosses
sample(x=c("Heads","Tails"),size=3,replace=TRUE)

#another example -simulating repeated throw of dice
#Here we simulate 2 dice being thrown at a time
sample(x=c(1:6),size=2,replace=TRUE)

#another example - simulating the results of an experiment, where the probability of success is 70% and probability of failure is 30%
#additional arguments need to be specified for the probabilities
#experiments are repeated and hence, we have sampling with replacement

#Here the experiment is repeated 4 times
sample(x=c("Result-Success","Result-Failure"),size=4,prob=c(0.70,0.30),replace=TRUE)

#final example - simulate 7 days of likely weather, where probabilities are different for each weather type
sample(x=c("rainy","sunny","cloudy"),size=7,replace=TRUE,prob=c(0.60,0.30,0.10))


```

Combinatorics in R
Using choose function to return the number of combinations of n things, taken k at a time

```{r}

#number of combinations of n things taken r at a time
choose(5,2)

#to list out the combinations using the combn function
combn(5,2)
combn(4,2)

combn(c("a","b","c"),2)



```

#### Discrete distributions
Random variable X has a probability distribution. 
The probability distribution can be described using point probabilities f(x) =P(X=x) or using cumulative distribution function F(x) =P(X<=x)
