#### Univariate analysis of numeric data - Descriptive Statistics
Recipes for performing univariate analysis of the columns in the form of various descriptive statistics

```{r}

#get summary statistics for a numeric variable 
summary(iris$Sepal.Length)

#get the five number summary using the fivenum function
#the results are minimum, 25% percentile, median, 75% percentile, maximum
fivenum(iris$Sepal.Length)

#using the stat.desc() function from the pastecs package to provide more descriptive statistics
#number of values, nulls, missing values, min, max, range, summary statistics and coefficient of variation are available
descriptive_stats=stat.desc(iris$Sepal.Length) #this is a named numeric vector

#### Converting a numeric variable to categorical by  binning it
For the numeric variable, we need to specify the number of bins and the cut points for the frequency distribution. This recipe helps us to convert a numeric variable into a categorical variable by  binning it.

```{r}
#Example 1 - we will use the faithful dataset for obtaining frequency distribution of the eruptions variable

#step 1 -get the range of the numeric variable of interest
range_eruptions =range(faithful$eruptions)
range_eruptions

#step 2 - define the break points to be used by using the range created above
#since the range is 1.6 and 5.1-  we will define the start point as 1.5 and end point as 5.5 and cut slice by 0.5
breaks_eruptions = seq(from=range_eruptions[1],to=range_eruptions[2],by=0.5)
breaks_eruptions

#step 3 - use the cut function now - whereby the numeric vector gets binned 
#the interval is closed on the left, open on the right
faithful_cuts =cut(x=faithful$eruptions,breaks=breaks_eruptions,right=FALSE)

#step 4 - final step - now use table function on the variable created above
table(faithful_cuts)

#step 5-visualize result -can visualize the distribution using a barplot
barplot(table(faithful_cuts))

#Example 2 - another example for frequency distribution using the Temperature variable from the airquality dataset
range_temperature=range(airquality$Temp)
range_temperature # range is from 56 to 97
#defining cut points from 50 to 100 in steps of 5
breaks_temperature=seq(from=50,to=100,by=5)
breaks_temperature
#cut the Temp variable
temperature_cuts =cut(airquality$Temp,breaks=breaks_temperature,right=FALSE)
#get the summary frequency distribution table 
table(temperature_cuts)
#can visualize the distribution using a barplot
barplot(table(temperature_cuts))

```

#### Testing normality of variable 
Shapiro wilks test of normality can be used to test for normality of a variable 

```{r}
#use shapiro.test for testing the normality of a variable

#null hypothesis - variable follows a normal distribution. If we are not able to reject null hypothesis, then the normality assumption is likely valid
shapiro.test(iris$Sepal.Length)

```

species_proportions=prop.table(species_counts)
species_proportions

#to check the levels of a factor variable
levels(iris$Species) #by default, the levels are ordered in alphabetic order


```

#Example - we plot and compare the distribution of Sepal.Length versus Sepal.Width
# we are making use of the col argument with rgb(red, green, blue, alpha)
#by making only one color 1 and rest 0, and also using alpha -we are able to control the 
#coloring and transparency of the two histograms
#Note that col=rbg(1,1,1,1) creates white, and rgb(0,0,0,1) creates black
hist(iris$Sepal.Length,main ='Overlapping histograms',xlim=c(0,max(iris$Sepal.Length)),col=rgb(1,0,0,0.5),xlab='values')
hist(iris$Sepal.Width,add=TRUE,col=rgb(0,0,1,0.5))

```{r}
#example - we want to obtain a dotplot of the mpg variable from mtcars, grouped by the cylinder factor variable 

# Dotplot: Grouped Sorted and Colored. Also sorted by mpg, group and color by cylinder. Some preprocessing and data prep tasks are required to accomplish this
mpg_sorted=mtcars[order(mtcars$mpg),] # sort by mpg
mtcars$cyl=as.factor(mtcars$cyl)

mtcars$color[mtcars$cyl==4]='red'
mtcars$color[mtcars$cyl==6]='green'

chisq.test(x=Cars93$AirBags,y=Cars93$Origin) #result is that null hypothesis cannot be rejected. It means, the two variables are likely to be independent of each other. A mosaic plot will show that the proportions do not differ much
mosaicplot(table(Cars93$AirBags,Cars93$Origin))

#is drive train variable indepdent of the cylinders variable in the Cars93 dataset

```


#### Recipes for detecting and visualizing outliers - univariate and multivariate approaches

A simple recipe for detecting outliers in a given numeric variable is to determine the inter-quartile range. Any observations outside of the bounds of the IQR are likely candidates for being outliers

Another recipe is to plot boxplots and look for outliers
Also, you can use some custom functions which look for outliers in the data and then report them.

```{r}

#get the IQR for pressure variable in the pressure dataset 
IQR_pressure =quantile(pressure$pressure,probs=c(0.25,0.75))
IQR_pressure
#identify observations which lie outside of the IQR
candidate_outlier_observations =subset(pressure,select=pressure,subset=pressure>IQR_pressure[2]| pressure <IQR_pressure[1])

candidate_outlier_observations # there are 10 records out of 19 records - very small values and vergy large values for pressure

#another simpler way to catch outliers is to draw a boxplot to look at the distribution of the variable 
boxplot(pressure$pressure)

#another way to visualize outliers is to draw boxplot of the numeric variable versus another categorical variable - this way, some categories where the numeric variable takes extreme values can get highlighted
boxplot(Ozone~Month,data=airquality) # there are some months where outlier values are found

#use the outlier function from the outlier package 
outlier(pressure$pressure,opposite=TRUE) # having the largest difference from mean 
outlier(pressure$pressure,opposite=FALSE) # having smallest difference from mean

#if instead of the values, you would lke the positions - so that you can extract them later, use logical=FALSE
outlier(pressure$pressure,logical=TRUE)

#using the chisq.out.test from the outliers package for detecting outliers
#this argument opposite is a bit confusion
# if opposite =TRUE, if largest value has maximum difference from the mean, it gives smallest and vice versa)
chisq.out.test(x=mtcars$wt,opposite=TRUE)  
chisq.out.test(x=airquality$Temp,opposite=FALSE) 

```

#### Multivariate analysis

Recipe for multivariate notched boxplot 

```{r}
#let us compare the distributio of mpg versus the cylinder and am variable 
#on x-axis, we have cyl=4,6,8+am=0 and then we have cyl =4,6,8 +am=1
boxplot(mtcars$mpg~as.factor(mtcars$cyl)*as.factor(mtcars$am),notch=TRUE)

```

#### Exploring and analyzing missing data in the dataset
Recipes for functions for checking the existence and extent of missing data in the dataset


```{r}

```

Recipe when you want to visualize the relationship between tow numeric variables, and add dimension of a third categorical variable
```{r}
#example - visualize weight versus mpg, based on the cylinder
#we use the enchanced scatter plot functionality from the car package -legends are provided automatically.

scatterplot(mpg~wt|cyl,data=mtcars,xlab='wt of car',ylab='mileage',smooth=FALSE)

#another example using airquality data 
#plot RPM versus fuel tank capacity and origin as the third dimension
scatterplot(RPM~Fuel.tank.capacity|as.factor(Origin),data=Cars93,smooth=FALSE)

```

Recipe for scatteplot matrices  - to visualize a large number of numeric variables at a time

```{r}
#uses the pairs function to draw scatterplot matrices
pairs(iris[,c(1:4)])

#in pairs function, we can list the specific numeric variables that we want
#use airquality data and obtain scatterplo for ozone, wind, temperature
pairs(~Ozone+Wind+Temp,data=airquality)

```

Recipe for scatter plot matrices -to visualize a large number of numeric variables at a time and conditioned on a factor variable 

```{r}

#again using car package and the function called scatterplotMatrix
scatterplotMatrix(~mpg+disp+drat+wt|cyl,data=mtcars, main='three cylinder options')

#example 2 - plot the numeric variables in iris dataset conditioned on the species factor variable 
scatterplotMatrix(~Sepal.Length+Petal.Length|Species,data=iris)

```
