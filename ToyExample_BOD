## Toy example for using the benefit of the doubt approach to build a composite indicator


### Import required packages

```{r,message=F,warning=F}
library(Compind)
library(dplyr)

```

We use the package Compind for building composite indicator


### Create toy data 

We create simple toy data for this example
Dataset has four attributes -headcount(number of people in branch), deposits(amount of deposits held), number of customers,  and ARPU(average revenue per user). Data is fake, just created for this toy example

```{r}

unit=c("A","B","C","D","E")
HeadCount=c(100,120,170,200,250)
Number_Customers=c(1200,1500,1700,2000,4000)
ARPU=c(15.0,16.2,25.0,8.0,10.0)

input_data=data.frame(unit=unit,HeadCount=HeadCount,Number_Customers=Number_Customers,ARPU=ARPU)

```

### Data pre-processing steps - standardization

```{r}

input_data_scaled=scale(x=input_data[,c(2:4)])


```

### Version 1 of BOD approach using the ci_bod function - weights don't add up to 1
In this version, we just use the ci_bod function with no thresholds
We see that the weights DO NOT add up to one in this case

```{r}

BOD_version_1=ci_bod(x=input_data_scaled,indic_col=c(1:3))
names(BOD_version_1)



```

### Version 1 - Look at the results 

The composite score is a number between 0 and 1
When we look at the weights assigned for each record -we see that the sum of the weights are not
necessarily 1

```{r}
#get the composite indicator score results
BOD_version_1$ci_bod_est

#get the weights assigned for each record
BOD_version_1$ci_bod_weights

```

### Version 2 of BOD approach using the ci_bod_constr function - weights add up to 1
In this version, we are able to set the lower and upper threshold for the weights
We see that the weights add up to one in this case
```{r}
BOD_version_2=ci_bod_constr(x=input_data_scaled,indic_col=c(1:3),up_w=1.0,low_w=0.0)
names(BOD_version_2)

```

### Version 2 - Look at the results 

The composite score is a number between 0 and 1
When we look at the weights assigned for each record -we see that the sum of the weights add to 1
```{r}
#get the composite indicator score results
BOD_version_2$ci_bod_constr_est

#get the weights assigned for each record
BOD_version_2$ci_bod_constr_weights

```
