#### Demonstration for different algorithms for building decision trees

Recipe for implementing CART algorithm - using rpart package and using caret package
Recipe for building tree with default options and then tuning the tree parameters

#### Import required libraries

```{r}

library(datasets) # for using the longley dataset
library(caret) # we use for data partition into 80% training and 20% test. also train CART using caret
library(rpart) # for implementing CART using non-caret version

```

#### Import dataset used for practice

```{r}
data(iris) # classification where target variable is categorical
data("longley") # classification where target variable is numeric

```

#### CART using rpart package, target variable = categorical

Recipe for implementing CART using the rpart package, target variable is categorical

```{r}

#partition dataset into training data and testing data
set.seed(100)
train_labels=createDataPartition(y=iris$Species,times=1,p=0.8,list=FALSE)
iris_training=iris[train_labels,]
iris_testing=iris[-train_labels]

#use rpart package to build the CART model
iris_CART_model =rpart(formula=Species~.,data=iris_training,na.action="na.pass",method="class")

```
