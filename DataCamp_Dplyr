##Notes
dplyr aggregate functions

dplyr provides several helpful aggregate functions of its own, in addition to the ones that are already defined in R. These include:

first(x) - The first element of vector x.
last(x) - The last element of vector x.
nth(x, n) - The nth element of vector x.
n() - The number of rows in the data.frame or group of observations that summarise() describes.
n_distinct(x) - The number of unique values in vector x.
Next to these dplyr-specific functions, you can also turn a logical test into an aggregating function with sum() or mean(). A logical test returns a vector of TRUE's and FALSE's. When you apply sum() or mean() to such a vector, R coerces each TRUE to a 1 and each FALSE to a 0. sum() then represents the total number of observations that passed the test; mean() represents the proportion.

##Instructions
Print out a summary of hflights with the following variables:
n_obs: the total number of observations,
n_carrier: the total number of carriers,
n_dest: the total number of destinations,
aa, a tbl with all flights flown by American Airlines, is already available.
Print out a summary of aa with the following variables:
n_flights: the total number of flights (each observation is a flight),
n_canc: the total number of cancelled flights,
avg_delay: the average arrival delay of flights whose delay is not NA (na.rm = TRUE).

##Code

```{r}
# hflights is available with full names for the carriers

# Generate summarizing statistics for hflights
summarise(hflights,
          n_obs = n(),
          n_carrier = n_distinct(UniqueCarrier),
          n_dest = n_distinct(Dest)
          )

# All American Airline flights
aa <- filter(hflights, UniqueCarrier == "American")

# Generate summarizing statistics for aa 
summarise(aa,
          n_flights=n(),
          n_canc=sum(Cancelled==1),
          avg_delay=mean(ArrDelay,na.rm=TRUE)
          )

```
