##Interval Estimation Techniques recipes

Estimating population parameters based on sample data

####Load packages to use and datasets to use

```{r}

library(MASS)
library(TeachingDemos) #for using some standard statistical test functions
data("survey") # dataset to use is called survey

```

#### Recipes follow one after the other
Point estimate for population mean - simply take the mean using the sample data, the specific column under consideration

```{r}
#point estimate for height
height_point_estimate =mean(survey$Height, na.rm=TRUE)
height_point_estimate

```

Interval estimate for population mean - population variance is known

```{r}
#assume the known population variance is 9.48
population_stdev_known =9.48

#formula based approach to get the interval estimate

#step 1 - get the number of valid non-missing observations in sample
number_observations = length(na.omit(survey$Height))
number_observations

#step 2- calculate standard error of the mean 
height_standard_error_mean =population_stdev_known/sqrt(number_observations)

#step 3 - plug in values in the standard formula for lower estimate and upper estimate
#for that we need the z-values associated with the confidence interval bounds
#suppose we want 95% confidence intervals - lower bound 2.5% , upper bound 97.5%

#getting the upper tail and lower tail quantiles
upper_tail=qnorm(0.975)
lower_tail=qnorm(0.025)

#final step -getting the interval estimate
height_mean_interval_estimate =height_point_estimate+height_standard_error_mean*c(lower_tail,upper_tail)


```

Interval estimate for population mean - population variance is not known
Process is almost similar to the previous recipe. Only difference is considering the sample standard deviation as estimate for the population standard deviation.
