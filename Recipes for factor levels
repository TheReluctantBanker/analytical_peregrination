#### Recipes for working with factor variables

Recipe 1
Changing the order of levels of a factor. When you want to change the order in which the factor levels appear

Example for ordered factor {small, medium, large}
Example for unordered factor {pen, pencil, eraser}

When order is not specified, R will use the alphabetical order for ordering the factor levels

```{r}

example_factor=factor(x=c("small", "medium", "large"))
example_factor

#now to change the levels of the factor small-->medium-->large
#method 1 - to specify the order of the factor levels explicitly when creating the factor, using the levels #argument
example_factor=factor(example_factor,levels=c("small","medium","large"))
example_factor # the levels would have changed now

#method 2 - create an ordered factor
example_factor2=c("low risk","high risk","medium risk","low risk","high risk","high risk")
example_factor2=ordered(example_factor2,levels=c("low risk","medium risk","high risk"))
example_factor2

#another example
example_factor3=factor(x=c("adolescent","senile","baby", "child", "adult"))
example_factor3

example_factor3=ordered(example_factor3,levels=c("baby","child","adolescent","adult","senile"))
example_factor3

#method 3-Another way to change the order is to use relevel() to make a particular level first in the list. #This will not work for ordered factors.
#it can only help to make a particular level the first level

#you can see that the factor levels are mixed up in the example factor below


#lets use the relevel function to correct things - relevel basically  helps to fix the reference level
sizes = factor(c("small", "large", "large", "small", "medium"))
sizes 
#now we just need to make small the first level
sizes=relevel(sizes,ref="small")
#check the results
sizes


```
